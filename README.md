Sign language could be hard for many people to learn as each letter or word has a different sign.
With this code normal poeple could be able to communicate with deaf poeple, the spoken word is converted into text then interpreted by the avatar.
The avatar recognizes the spoken word and interact with it by expressing its corresponding sign in sign language.
In this way normal people can communicate with deaf people without learning sign language.
We can record either a word or a letter as the sign of each letter differs from sign of each word.
Each sign is stored into the avatar by creating new animation named by its corresponding word.
